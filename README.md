This code is an assignment from the Python for Everybody course from University of Michigan, 
the original code processes the file in a loop where the insert to the database is made in each iteration,
this code instead counts through the data the quantity of mails per domain, stores it in a dictionary to then
do another loop through the dictionary to insert the values calculated, this method makes it so we have to
do way less writes and calls to the database while permiting the features of the original code.
